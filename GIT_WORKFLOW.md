## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process
For critical medical issues or security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-medical-bug

# After fix and testing
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-medical-bug
git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "Hotfix: Critical medical calculation error"
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/critical-medical-bug
```

### Emergency Deployment
- **Bypass normal review** (document post-deployment)
- **Immediate deployment** to production
- **Real-time monitoring** activation
- **Clinical staff notification** 
- **Post-incident review** required

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Immediate rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/clinchat-api
docker tag clinchat:v1.1.0 clinchat:latest

# Database rollback (if needed)
# Execute rollback scripts in reverse order
```

## üìä Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Medical Accuracy:** Clinical prediction accuracy
- **System Performance:** Response times, uptime
- **Security:** Failed login attempts, data access
- **Compliance:** Audit log completeness
- **User Adoption:** Clinical usage patterns

### Alerting Thresholds
