## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS FOR DEPLOYMENT**

### **Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets** (Manual)
Go to: https://github.com/reddygautam98/clinchat-rag/settings/secrets/actions

Add these 4 repository secrets:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = [Your working Access Key from .env file]
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = [Your working Secret Key from .env file] 
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = us-east-1
TF_STATE_BUCKET = clinchat-terraform-state-bucket
```

### **Step 2: Trigger Deployment**
After GitHub secrets are configured, any push to main will trigger deployment:
```bash
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Monitor Deployment**
