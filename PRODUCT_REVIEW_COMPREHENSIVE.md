    def __init__(self):
        self.provider_profiles = {
            "gemini": {
                ProviderCapability.REASONING: 0.95,
                ProviderCapability.ACCURACY: 0.92,
            },
            "groq": {
                ProviderCapability.SPEED: 0.98,
                ProviderCapability.COST_EFFICIENCY: 0.94,
            }
        }
```
- **Innovation**: First-class fusion of multiple AI providers
- **Performance**: Automated selection based on analysis type (emergency vs. routine)
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent routing minimizes API costs

#### 2. **Database Architecture** - *Very Good*
```sql
