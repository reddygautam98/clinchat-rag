🔧 AWS S3 BACKEND FIX - COMPLETE GUIDE
=====================================

CURRENT SITUATION:
❌ AWS quarantined credentials due to git exposure
❌ AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantineV3 policy blocks S3 access
✅ Infrastructure deploys with local backend (working)
🎯 GOAL: Restore S3 backend for production state management

STEP 1: CREATE NEW AWS CREDENTIALS
==================================

1.1 Open AWS Console:
    → https://console.aws.amazon.com/
    → Sign in to account: 607520774335

1.2 Navigate to IAM:
    → Services → IAM → Users → clinchat-github-actions

1.3 Remove Quarantine Policy:
    → Permissions tab
    → Find "AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantineV3"
    → Click "Remove policy" (X button)
    → Confirm removal

1.4 Create New Access Key:
    → Security credentials tab
    → Access keys section
    → Click "Create access key"
    → Use case: "Application running outside AWS"
    → Click "Next" → Create access key
    → SAVE the new credentials (you won't see them again!)
    
1.5 Delete Old Access Key:
    → Find the old access key: AKIAY24YPLC7UTG7RIU2
    → Click "Delete"
    → Type "Delete" to confirm

STEP 2: UPDATE GITHUB SECRETS
=============================

2.1 Go to GitHub Repository:
    → https://github.com/reddygautam98/clinchat-rag/settings/secrets/actions

2.2 Update AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:
    → Click on "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
    → Click "Update"
    → Enter NEW access key ID
    → Click "Update secret"

2.3 Update AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:
    → Click on "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"  
    → Click "Update"
    → Enter NEW secret access key
    → Click "Update secret"

STEP 3: RE-ENABLE S3 BACKEND
============================

3.1 The following files need to be updated:
    → infrastructure/main.tf (uncomment S3 backend)
    → .github/workflows/deploy-infrastructure.yml (add S3 config)

3.2 Automatic fix will be applied after you update GitHub secrets

STEP 4: VERIFY AND DEPLOY
=========================

4.1 Test New Credentials:
    → Push any change to trigger deployment
    → Monitor GitHub Actions for success
    → Verify S3 bucket access in logs

4.2 Expected Results:
    ✅ Terraform state stored in S3
    ✅ State locking with DynamoDB
    ✅ Shared state for team collaboration
    ✅ Production-ready infrastructure

ALTERNATIVE: AUTOMATED CREDENTIAL ROTATION
=========================================

If you have AWS CLI configured with admin access:

1. Run: aws iam create-access-key --user-name clinchat-github-actions
2. Copy new credentials to GitHub secrets
3. Run: aws iam delete-access-key --user-name clinchat-github-actions --access-key-id AKIAY24YPLC7UTG7RIU2

NEED HELP?
==========
✅ Current deployment works with local backend
✅ All infrastructure resources deploy normally  
✅ Application is fully functional
⚠️ Only state management is local vs S3

You can proceed with local backend for now and fix S3 later!

S3 BACKEND CONFIGURATION:
========================
After updating GitHub secrets, restore this configuration:

File: infrastructure/main.tf
{terraform_backend}

This will be automatically applied once you confirm new credentials are working.
