### 🚀 **Next Steps**

#### 1️⃣ **GitHub Secrets Configuration** (Required)
Configure at: https://github.com/reddygautam98/clinchat-rag/settings/secrets/actions

Add these repository secrets:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = [YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID]
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = [YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = us-east-1
TF_STATE_BUCKET = clinchat-terraform-state-bucket
```

#### 2️⃣ **Trigger Deployment**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "AWS credentials configured successfully"
git push origin main
```

#### 3️⃣ **Monitor Deployment**
- Watch GitHub Actions tab for workflow execution
- Monitor AWS Console for resource creation
- Check deployment logs for any issues
