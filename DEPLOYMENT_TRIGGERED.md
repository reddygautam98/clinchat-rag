## 🚨 **IF DEPLOYMENT FAILS**

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**
1. **Permission Errors**: Check IAM policies are attached
2. **Resource Conflicts**: Terraform will handle existing resources  
3. **Timeout Issues**: GitHub Actions has 30-minute timeout
4. **Docker Build Fails**: Check Dockerfile syntax

### **Troubleshooting:**
- Review GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages
- Check AWS CloudFormation/Terraform state in AWS console
- Verify all GitHub secrets are correctly configured

---

## 📞 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Monitor**: Watch GitHub Actions progress
2. **Verify**: Check AWS console for resource creation
3. **Test**: Access public URL when deployment completes
4. **Celebrate**: 🎉 Full AWS deployment achieved!
