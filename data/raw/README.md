## Data Privacy & Compliance

### Synthetic Data Only
All sample files in this directory contain **SYNTHETIC DATA ONLY**. No real patient data, proprietary clinical information, or confidential business information is included.

### PHI Considerations
- All patient identifiers are synthetic
- Dates are fictional or anonymized
- Geographic locations are generalized
- No real patient health information is included

### Data Generation Sources
- **Text Content**: Generated using privacy-conscious AI models
- **Numerical Data**: Programmatically generated with realistic distributions
- **Medical Terms**: Based on public medical vocabularies (MedDRA, SNOMED CT)
- **Regulatory Content**: Based on publicly available guidance documents
