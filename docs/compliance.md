## PHI (Protected Health Information) Classification

### Direct Identifiers (Must be Protected/Redacted)
- [ ] Names (first, last, maiden)
- [ ] Geographic subdivisions smaller than state
- [ ] Dates directly related to an individual
- [ ] Telephone numbers
- [ ] Email addresses
- [ ] Social Security numbers
- [ ] Medical record numbers
- [ ] Health plan beneficiary numbers
- [ ] Account numbers
- [ ] Certificate/license numbers
- [ ] Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers
- [ ] Device identifiers and serial numbers
- [ ] Web URLs
- [ ] IP addresses
- [ ] Biometric identifiers
- [ ] Full-face photographs
- [ ] Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code

### Quasi-Identifiers (Require Risk Assessment)
- [ ] Age (if >89, group as 90+)
- [ ] Gender
- [ ] Race/ethnicity
- [ ] Geographic regions (state level acceptable)
- [ ] Occupation
- [ ] Dates (year only generally acceptable)

### Clinical Data Classifications
- [ ] **Public**: Published studies, aggregate statistics
- [ ] **Internal**: Proprietary but non-identifiable research data
- [ ] **Confidential**: Individual patient data, identifiable information
- [ ] **Restricted**: Sensitive clinical data requiring special handling

## Data Handling Strategy

### Real PHI vs. Synthetic Data Decision Matrix

| Use Case | Data Type | Justification | Requirements |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Development & Testing** | Synthetic Only | Zero risk approach | No compliance overhead |
| **Internal Research** | De-identified Real | Research value | IRB approval required |
| **Production System** | TBD | Business decision | Full compliance required |
| **Demos & Training** | Synthetic Only | Public presentation | No restrictions |

### Recommended Approach for MVP
**DECISION: Use Synthetic Data Only**
- **Rationale**: Eliminates compliance complexity for MVP
- **Benefits**: Faster development, no legal review delays
- **Limitations**: May not capture all real-world edge cases
- **Transition Plan**: Design system to handle real PHI for future phases

---

## Technical Security Controls

### Encryption Requirements

#### Data at Rest
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault
- **Scope**: All databases, file storage, backups
- **Implementation**: 
  ```python
  # Database level encryption
  DATABASE_ENCRYPTION = "AES-256"
  FIELD_LEVEL_ENCRYPTION = ["patient_id", "medical_record_number"]
  
  # File storage encryption
  S3_ENCRYPTION = "aws:kms"
  LOCAL_STORAGE_ENCRYPTION = "LUKS"
  ```

#### Data in Transit
- **Protocol**: TLS 1.3 minimum
- **Certificates**: Valid SSL certificates from trusted CA
- **API Security**: All endpoints require HTTPS
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # FastAPI TLS configuration
  app.add_middleware(
      HTTPSRedirectMiddleware
  )
  uvicorn.run(app, ssl_keyfile="key.pem", ssl_certfile="cert.pem")
  ```

#### Key Management
- **Rotation**: Automated 90-day rotation
- **Storage**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) or cloud KMS
- **Access**: Role-based key access controls
- **Backup**: Secure key escrow procedures

### Access Control (RBAC)

#### Role Definitions
```yaml
roles:
  admin:
    permissions: [create, read, update, delete, manage_users]
    scope: all_data
  
  clinical_researcher:
    permissions: [read, query, export]
    scope: assigned_studies
  
  data_scientist:
    permissions: [read, analyze]
    scope: de_identified_data
  
  auditor:
    permissions: [read_logs, read_metadata]
    scope: audit_trails
  
  viewer:
    permissions: [read]
    scope: public_data
```

#### Authentication Requirements
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all users
- **Session Management**: 30-minute timeout, secure session tokens
- **Password Policy**: Minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements
- **Account Lockout**: 5 failed attempts triggers 15-minute lockout

### Network Security
- **Firewall**: Application-level firewall (WAF)
- **VPN**: Required for remote access
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated clinical data network
- **DDoS Protection**: Rate limiting and traffic analysis

---

## Audit Logging & Monitoring

### Audit Requirements (21 CFR Part 11 Compliant)

#### Required Audit Events
```python
AUDIT_EVENTS = {
    "data_access": {
        "user_id": "required",
        "timestamp": "required", 
        "action": "required",
        "resource": "required",
        "result": "required",
        "ip_address": "required"
    },
    "data_modification": {
        "user_id": "required",
        "timestamp": "required",
        "old_value": "required",
        "new_value": "required", 
        "reason": "required",
        "approval": "if_required"
    },
    "system_access": {
        "user_id": "required",
        "login_time": "required",
        "logout_time": "required", 
        "session_id": "required",
        "access_method": "required"
    }
}
```

#### Audit Log Properties
- **Immutability**: Write-once, tamper-evident storage
- **Retention**: 7 years minimum (clinical trial requirements)
- **Format**: Structured JSON with digital signatures
- **Storage**: Separate audit database with restricted access
- **Review**: Monthly audit log review process

#### Implementation Example
```python
class AuditLogger:
    def log_data_access(self, user_id, action, resource, result):
        audit_entry = {
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "user_id": user_id,
            "action": action,
            "resource": hash_resource_id(resource),
            "result": result,
            "ip_address": get_client_ip(),
            "session_id": get_session_id(),
            "checksum": calculate_checksum()
        }
        self.write_to_audit_store(audit_entry)
```

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Suspicious access patterns
- **Threshold Alerts**: Unusual data access volumes
- **Failed Access Attempts**: Multiple failed login attempts
- **System Health**: Database and application performance
- **Compliance Violations**: Automated detection of policy violations
