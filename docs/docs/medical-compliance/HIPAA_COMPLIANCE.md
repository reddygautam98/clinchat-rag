## üîç PHI Handling Procedures

### PHI Identification
```python
# Automated PHI Detection Patterns
PHI_PATTERNS = {
    "names": r"\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\b",
    "ssn": r"\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b",
    "phone": r"\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b",
    "email": r"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b",
    "medical_record_number": r"\b(MRN|mrn)[:=\s]*\d+\b",
    "dates": r"\b\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}[/-]\d{2,4}\b",
    "addresses": r"\b\d+\s+[A-Za-z\s]+(Street|St|Avenue|Ave|Road|Rd|Boulevard|Blvd)\b"
}

def detect_phi(text):
    """
    Detect potential PHI in text input
    Returns: List of detected PHI with locations and types
    """
    detected_phi = []
    for phi_type, pattern in PHI_PATTERNS.items():
        matches = re.finditer(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
        for match in matches:
            detected_phi.append({
                "type": phi_type,
                "value": match.group(),
                "start": match.start(),
                "end": match.end(),
                "risk_level": get_phi_risk_level(phi_type)
            })
    return detected_phi
```

### Minimum Necessary Standard
- **Query Processing**
  - Only clinically relevant information returned
  - User role determines data granularity
  - Automatic redaction of unnecessary identifiers
  - Purpose-based access controls

### De-identification Procedures
```python
# Safe Harbor De-identification
SAFE_HARBOR_IDENTIFIERS = [
    "names", "geographic_subdivisions", "dates", 
    "phone_numbers", "fax_numbers", "email_addresses",
    "ssn", "medical_record_numbers", "health_plan_numbers",
    "account_numbers", "certificate_numbers", "vehicle_identifiers",
    "device_identifiers", "web_urls", "ip_addresses",
    "biometric_identifiers", "face_photos", "other_unique_ids"
]

def deidentify_text(text, method="safe_harbor"):
    """
    Remove or replace PHI according to Safe Harbor method
    """
    if method == "safe_harbor":
        for identifier_type in SAFE_HARBOR_IDENTIFIERS:
            text = remove_identifier(text, identifier_type)
    
    return {
        "deidentified_text": text,
        "method": method,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
        "phi_removed_count": count_removed_identifiers(text)
    }
```

## üö® Breach Response Procedures

### Incident Detection
```yaml
Automated Monitoring:
  - Unusual access patterns
  - Failed authentication attempts
  - Large data exports
  - After-hours system access
  - Geographic anomalies

Alert Thresholds:
  - 5+ failed logins: Immediate alert
  - PHI access outside normal hours: Review required  
  - Bulk data download: Approval required
  - New device access: Multi-factor verification
```

### Breach Assessment Timeline
