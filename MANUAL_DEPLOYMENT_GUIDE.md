# 🚀 Manual Deployment Trigger Guide

## ✅ **Current Status:**
- GitHub Secrets: **CONFIGURED** ✅
- AWS Credentials: **WORKING** ✅
- Local Testing: **PASSED** ✅

## 📋 **Issue:** 
GitHub Push Protection is blocking automated deployment due to old commits containing credentials in git history.

## 🛠️ **Manual Deployment Options:**

### **Option 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)**

1. **Go to GitHub Actions**: 
   👉 https://github.com/reddygautam98/clinchat-rag/actions

2. **Find your workflow** (usually named "Deploy" or "CI/CD")

3. **Click "Run workflow"** button

4. **Select branch**: `main`

5. **Click "Run workflow"** to trigger deployment

### **Option 2: Bypass GitHub Protection**

1. **Click the GitHub protection bypass URL:**
   👉 https://github.com/reddygautam98/clinchat-rag/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34NrW1772ss3MvxunPJj4AKZXAF

2. **Allow the secret** for this specific push

3. **Run the push command again**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Option 3: Create New Clean Branch**

```bash
# Create a new clean branch
git checkout -b deploy-clean

# Create a trigger file
echo "Deployment trigger $(date)" > deployment-trigger.txt
git add deployment-trigger.txt
git commit -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin deploy-clean

# Create Pull Request to main branch
```

### **Option 4: Direct GitHub Repository Edit**

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/reddygautam98/clinchat-rag

2. **Edit any file** (like README.md)

3. **Add a line** like "Deployment triggered on $(date)"

4. **Commit directly** to main branch

5. **This will trigger** the workflow automatically

## 🎯 **Recommended Action:**

**Use Option 1** - Go to GitHub Actions and manually trigger the workflow. This is the cleanest approach.

## 📊 **What Happens After Deployment Triggers:**

1. **GitHub Actions** will start the workflow
2. **Terraform** will provision AWS infrastructure:
   - ECS Clusters
   - ECR Repositories  
   - Load Balancers
   - Networking components
3. **Docker images** will be built and deployed
4. **Application** will be accessible via Load Balancer URL

## 🔍 **Monitor Progress:**

Watch the deployment at: https://github.com/reddygautam98/clinchat-rag/actions

Expected deployment time: **15-25 minutes**

## ✅ **You're Ready!**

Your AWS credentials are working, GitHub secrets are configured, and the infrastructure is ready to deploy. Just trigger it using any of the options above! 🚀
